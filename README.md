# NASA Space Mission AI Project â€“ Conceptual Design Track

## Name
Carlos Granillo

## Track Chosen
Conceptual Design

## Brief Project Description
This project proposes a fully autonomous AI system for real-time detection of power loss anomalies in satellites. The AI monitors incoming telemetry data and flags early signs of failure or system degradation, enabling rapid mitigation during live missions. This tool is designed to enhance satellite reliability and reduce the risk of mission failure.
